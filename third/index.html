        <p>Start Deshaun Watson (vs. Cleveland): Regression will hit Watson at some point. On the year, he's got an 8.3% touchdown rate, when the league's average rate over the last few years has hovered the 4.5% mark. Watson's rate, in fact, has only been hit 11 times in NFL history among passers with 200 or more attempts.
                
                So, yeah, don't expect him to keep this up.
                
                But do expect him to post a nice fantasy performance in Week 6. He'll be at home against a Cleveland Browns defense that's now surrendered at least 13.5 standard fantasy points to every passer they've faced, and the list of quarterbacks they've gone up against Cleveland this year includes Joe Flacco, Jacoby Brissett, Andy Dalton, and Josh McCown. The Browns have the second-worst pass defense, according to our schedule-adjusted Net Expected Points (NEP) metric, too.</p>
